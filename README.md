Hi, I'm Brogan. 

I have a huge interest in Computer Science, especially Computer Vision, Machine Learning and general programming/software engineering.

Currently, I'm in my final year of a Computer Science Degree and planning on entering the industry in an AI/Data science centered role.

Here, you'll find some of the projects and challenges from courses I've completed on Udemy and Codecademy.
